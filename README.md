## Notice for Noroff Teachers
I have created test cases that were not explicitly requested by the assignment that do not follow the recommended/requested patterns/rules. These were created before I finished reading the assignment, and I did not feel like deleting work I had done. So I hope, when grading, that you'll ignore those and instead look at the ones the assignment requested that I did implement with the requested patterns/rules.
